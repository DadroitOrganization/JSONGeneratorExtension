### `Dadroit: Generate JSON Sample`

- **Purpose**: Automatically generate a JSON file based on a pre-defined template that was embedded in the extension for demonstration purposes.
- **How to Use**: After executing the command, you can view the template used for generating the JSON file opened in the VSCode editor.

### `Dadroit: Generate JSON`

- **Purpose**: Create a customized JSON file based on your own template code.
- **How to Use**:
    1. Open a new editor tab in VSCode.
    2. Paste or write your template code. For sample templates, you can visit our [GitHub samples](https://github.com/DadroitOrganization/Generator/tree/main/Samples).
    3. With the template opened in the editor, execute the `Dadroit: Generate JSON` command to generate the JSON file based on it.

After executing each command, you’ll be presented with 2 action buttons in the notification message which you can choose from. The first one is to open the resultant JSON data in VSCode, and the latter is for opening the JSON file location.

### Dynamic Templates

Use templates with loop syntax to handle repetitive data structures.

```json
{
	"List": {
		"$Loop": {
			"$From": 0,
			"$To": 9,
			"$Var": "I",
			"$Block": {
				"X": {
					"$GetVar": "I"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Random Data Generation

Use the template language's built-in random function to generate varied data in JSON files.

```json
{
    "Age": {"$Random": {"$Min": 25,"$Max": 75}
}
```
